# Sample code snippets of mini-implementations

- playfairCipher.cpp - Implementation of the playfair cipher with user defined key and variable

- fibonicci.s - A fibonacci program implemented in assembly

- ackerman.cpp - Implementation of the ackerman function which is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. The function grows very quickly so a normal processor stops after input values go higher than 4
